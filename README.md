# Final Project: CO2 Emissions and Waste Distribution in Indonesia

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict CO2 emissions and waste distribution trends in Indonesia. By utilizing predictive models and historical data, the project focuses on key areas such as waste by sector, CO2 emissions from transportation, and the impact of electric vehicles on reducing CO2 emissions. Additionally, the project explores methane and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, providing insights into the future growth and cumulative impact of emissions in the country.

## Objectives
Develop predictive models for CO2 emissions in Indonesia.
Analyze waste distribution by sector and predict future trends.
Evaluate methane and GHG emissions by different sectors (agriculture, industry, energy, etc.).
Provide insights on the role of electric vehicles in reducing CO2 emissions.

## Data Sources
The project uses historical data and predictions from the following sources:

Waste distribution data from the Indonesian waste sector (2019-2022).
° CO2 emissions data from various sectors (transportation, industry, agriculture, etc.).
° Predictive models from Looker Studio for CO2 consumption, cumulative growth, and savings from electric vehicles.

## Data Breakdown
### Waste Distribution by Type
° Food Waste: 40.47%
° Plastic: 17.79%
° Wood: 13.7%
° Cardboard: 11.89%
° Other: 6.7%
° Metal: 3.14%
° Fabric: 2.43%
° Glass: 2.14%
° Rubber: 1.74%

### CO2 Emissions from Transportation
The project highlights emissions from various transportation types:
° Motorcycles: 48.3% of total CO2 emissions from transportation.
° Cars, Heavy Duty Trucks, and Buses: 13.2% combined.
° Domestic Aviation: 8.8%
° Railways and Navigation: 3-5%

### Emission Reduction from Electric Vehicles
The predictive models forecast significant CO2 savings by increasing the number of electric vehicles in the country. Projections show that CO2 emissions could be reduced by up to 500K kg CO2e by 2025.

## Dashboard and Visualization
Interactive dashboards and visualizations were created using Looker Studio, allowing users to explore:

° Historical trends of CO2 and methane emissions from 1990 to 2020.
° Waste distribution and CO2 emissions across regions.
° Predictions for CO2 consumption and cumulative emissions.

The dashboards provide clear visual insights into the current state of waste management and emissions in Indonesia, while also forecasting future scenarios based on different parameters.
